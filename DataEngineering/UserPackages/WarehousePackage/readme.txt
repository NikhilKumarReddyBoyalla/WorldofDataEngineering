This is one of the interview questions at FAANG/ MAANG companies that rejected me right after the very first round.
And the question goes like this:

Implement a package for a warehouse scenario. The output must return all the entities that weigh more than 50 kgs



-->Group of input lists were given which held either the container details or the container and box details or both 
--> Each container can have a box that weighs something or the container with multiple boxes can also be summed up to 50 + kgs 
--> For this I would first cover concepts of OOP in python
